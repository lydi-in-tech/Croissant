      Croissants are an iconic French bakery and breakfast pastry. Now all over
      the world, they‚Äôre enjoyed not only for breakfast but also lunch and even
      as a snack along with a warm cup of coffee or tea. The croissant, however,
      has a long history of how it came to be what we all know and love today.

    <div class="heading">Why Are Croissants So, So Delicious?</div>

    <p>
      But what makes croissants so delicate, fragrant and delicious? The secret
      is butter, and always butter. A good croissant is made using high-quality,
      very high-fat butter. That‚Äôs what gives croissants their golden colour,
      their crispiness, and most importantly, the flakiness that we all know and
      love. Just check out our butter croissant! What makes a good croissant?
      Here are 5 signs to look out for: Puffiness: A perfect croissant will be
      incredibly puffy, resulting from expertly folded dough and many, many
      layers as a result. Lots of butter: The perfect croissant will have lots
      of high-quality, high-fat butter. This helps its flavour, crispiness,
      flakiness and colour. Crumbling: A good croissant will result in many
      fine, flaky crumbs from its flakiness, lightness and delicacy. Many
      layers: Lots of layers and holes are a sign of the perfect croissant.
      These layers take a very long time to be created by the chef with repeated
      folding over and over again. Crunchy shell: The exterior of the croissant
      will be deliciously crunchy, crispy and delicate, falling apart upon
      biting into it.

    <div class="heading">How Are They Best Enjoyed?</div>
    <p>
      Croissants are best enjoyed simple and on their own without any butter,
      jam or other toppings. In North America, it has become quite common to see
      croissants sliced in half and filled with traditional sandwich fillings
      like cheese, ham and lettuce. This is a fantastically delicious way to
      enjoy your croissants. We also wouldn‚Äôt mind some butter, jam or Nutella!
      If you were to go to a classic French bakery, however, you would be
      advised to enjoy your croissant as it is, with a cup of coffee or tea on
      the side, at most. Want to try Bisou‚Äôs croissants? We bake them fresh, in
      small batches, every single day at our French Bakery. We would be thrilled
      for you to try, just drop by to enjoy with a fresh cup of steaming hot
      coffee on a cold, rainy day
