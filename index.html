      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin,
      named for its historical crescent shape. Croissants and other viennoiserie
      are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough

            Why Are Croissants So, So Delicious?
          </div>

          <p>
            But what makes croissants so delicate, fragrant and delicious? The
            secret is butter, and always butter. A good croissant is made using
            high-quality, very high-fat butter. That‚Äôs what gives croissants
            their golden colour, their crispiness, and most importantly, the
            flakiness that we all know and love. Just check out our butter
            croissant! What makes a good croissant? Here are 5 signs to look out
            for: Puffiness: A perfect croissant will be incredibly puffy,
            resulting from expertly folded dough and many, many layers as a
            result. Lots of butter: The perfect croissant will have lots of
            high-quality, high-fat butter. This helps its flavour, crispiness,
            flakiness and colour. Crumbling: A good croissant will result in
            many fine, flaky crumbs from its flakiness, lightness and delicacy.
            Many layers: Lots of layers and holes are a sign of the perfect
            croissant. These layers take a very long time to be created by the
            chef with repeated folding over and over again. Crunchy shell: The
            exterior of the croissant will be deliciously crunchy, crispy and
            delicate, falling apart upon biting into it.

          <div class="heading text-center">How Are They Best Enjoyed?</div>
          <p>
            Croissants are best enjoyed simple and on their own without any
            butter, jam or other toppings. In North America, it has become quite
            common to see croissants sliced in half and filled with traditional
            sandwich fillings like cheese, ham and lettuce. This is a
            fantastically delicious way to enjoy your croissants. We also
            wouldn‚Äôt mind some butter, jam or Nutella! If you were to go to a
            classic French bakery, however, you would be advised to enjoy your
            croissant as it is, with a cup of coffee or tea on the side, at
            most. Want to try Bisou‚Äôs croissants? We bake them fresh, in small
            batches, every single day at our French Bakery. We would be thrilled
            for you to try, just drop by to enjoy with a fresh cup of steaming
            hot coffee on a cold, rainy day
